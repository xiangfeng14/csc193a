<p><strong>Minesweeper</strong> is a puzzle game made crated by Microsoft in the 1990s.
  The objective of the game is to find all the <strong>mines</strong> on the board without clicking on a single mine. 
  The game has a grid of clickable tiles; under the tiles will be either a number, a blank, or a mine. 
  The numbers tell the player how many mines are under the adjacent titles. The play will <strong>flag</strong> the tite where they think the mines are. 
  The player <strong>wins</strong> the game when all mines are found. In the new versions of Windows, Minesweeper does not come predownloaded.
